This repository is used to learn how to work in the FreeCodeCamp-SLC GitHub Environment. Practice here before making contributions to our other repositories.

Rules to remember.
1. <Critical> Don't work directly on the "master" branch
2. Clone to your local account (e.g. PC)
3. Create a branch to work on (e.g. "git checkout addComment)
4. Keep what you do in a branch small (small changes are easier to merge)

If you make a mistake, no worries ... learning is what this repository is all about.  And, we'd rather you experimented here than on the main repositories.
